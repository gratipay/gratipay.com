These Terms of Service ("Terms") are an agreement between you, a user
("Participant") of the Gratipay service (the "Service"), and Gratipay, LLC
("Gratipay"). They govern your use of the Service and your relationship with
Gratipay. When you register as a Gratipay Participant, you agree to be bound by
these Terms.

If you have any questions about these terms, please contact us:

1. Registration, Security, and Privacy

  1. When you register for the Service, you agree to provide Gratipay with
     complete and accurate registration information. You are responsible for
keeping your account information, including your contact and payment
information, up to date. Gratipay takes our Participants' privacy seriously. We
will only use or share your information and Content as described in our Privacy
Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms.

  1. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account
     information, including your password. You agree to notify Gratipay
immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your
password. Gratipay shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your
failure to keep your account secure.

  1. You may only use the Service if you are 13 years old or older, and you
     represent to us that you 13 or older. If you are under the age of 18, your
legal guardian must consent to your use and must agree to be bound by these
Terms.

1. The Gratipay Model and Rules

  1. The Service is a platform to enable Teams of Gratipay Participants to
     receive payments to fund Open Work. Open Work means that the Team provides
a clear path for any individual to voluntarily begin contributing to the Team's
work and to be paid for their contribution. Some examples of Teams performing
Open Work include an open source software project that pays contributors, or a
hackerspace that pays individuals to teach classes or manage its operations.

  1. The Participant who establishes a Team is its Owner. Teams may optionally
     have other Members.

  1. When you establish a Team on the Service to fund your Open Work, you agree
     that payments will be used exclusively to support the Open Work described
in your Team's profile.

  1. When you make a payment to a Team, it is a payment to fund the Open Work
     the Team provides. You understand and acknowledge that your payment does
not entitle you personally to receive any goods or services from the Team,
unless the Team explicitly offers those things to Participants.

  1. By accepting a payment from a Participant, a Team forms an agreement with
     that Participant to perform the Open Work described in its profile. The
Service is a platform to facilitate this agreement. Gratipay is not a party to
the agreement, and is not responsible to either the Team or the Participant if
either party breaches the terms of the Agreement (e.g. if the Team fails to
provide the promised services).

  1. Gratipay does not provide refunds. Teams are responsible for producing the
     Open Work they offer. Gratipay does not hold funds on behalf of Teams,
does not warrant or guarantee that Teams will provide the Open Work they
promise.

1. Payroll Rules

  1. Teams can use the Service's Payroll feature to automatically divide
     incoming payments among Team Members, according to the allocation set by
the Members.

  1. Gratipay does not determine how a Team's Payroll is allocated and is not
     responsible for how Teams internally distribute payments. The agreement
between Team Members and Owners regarding the allocation of payments is solely
between those parties.

1. Rules for Gratipay Teams

  1. Teams may accept payments on the Service only for Open Work, meaning that
     they provide a clear path for any individual to voluntarily begin
contributing to the Team's work, and to be paid for their contribution.

  1. A Team can only begin receiving payments from Participants once it has
     provided a working withdrawal mechanism for receiving payments (e.g. bank
account information).

  1. Teams and their Open Work must be consistent with Gratipay's Brand
     Guidelines, Community Guidelines, and Acceptable Use Policy.

  1. Gratipay reserves the right to reject, suspend, or remove a Team at any
     time, and for any reason.

  1. When a new Team is established, the Gratipay community will have the
     opportunity to evaluate and provide commentary about the Team on
Gratipay's Github repository. However, all decisions regarding whether to
accept, reject, suspend, remove, or take any other action regarding a Team
belong solely to Gratipay.

1. Fees and Taxes

  1. Gratipay does not take any fee from payments made by Participants to
     Teams. Gratipay and the Service are funded through the Service itself, by
voluntary contributions from Gratipay Participants and Teams who wish to fund
our own Open Work. To contribute to Gratipay, please visit Gratipay's Team
page.

  1. You are responsible for paying any third-party fees associated with your
     use of the Service, such as credit card and bank fees.

  1. You are responsible for paying any taxes and withholdings associated with
     your use of the Service. Team Owners, and not Gratipay, are responsible
for any taxes and withholdings required by applicable law with respect to
payments made to Team Members (whether through the Payroll feature or
otherwise), including without limitation payroll tax, unemployment insurance,
and worker compensation insurance payments. Team Owners are also responsible
for providing any required tax and other documentation to employees,
independent contractors, tax authorities, or any other person.

1. Content Accessible on the Services

  1. With the exception of content provided by Participants of the Service, the
     contents of Gratipay.com&mdash;including all text, images, data, software,

  1. All content accessible through the Service is the sole responsibility of
     the person who provides it, and Gratipay is not responsible for content
provided by any Participant or third party. We do not represent or warrant the
truthfulness, reliability, or accuracy of any content, or that the content does
not infringe the rights of third parties. Gratipay shall not be responsible for
any loss or damage arising out of your access to, use of, or reliance on the
content.

  1. Gratipay reserves the right to remove content for any reason, including
     that it violates our Acceptable Use Policy. The Service may allow
Participants to flag or report graphic, abusive, or otherwise objectionable
content, and Gratipay may disable or filter access to flagged or reported
content. However, Gratipay has no obligation to monitor, filter, or disable
access to any content, and shall not be responsible if you encounter
objectionable content by using the Service.

  1. The Service, including Team profiles, may contain links to other websites.
     When you access third-party websites linked to from the Service, you do so
at your own risk. Gratipay does not review, control, or endorse those sites.

1. License to Your content

  1. You retain your rights to any content you provide through the Service.
     When you provide content through the Service, you grant to Gratipay a

known or later developed. 

  1. This license permits Gratipay to operate, promote, and improve the
     Service, and to develop new Service. It also permits Gratipay to provide,
publish, or syndicate the content to third parties, for example by providing
for the embedding of content on other services.

  1. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and authority
     to grant this license to Gratipay. With regard to any third-party content
that you submit, you represent and warrant that you have a license to provide
the content according these Terms, or that your use is otherwise permissible,
for example as fair use.

1. Gratipay's Service Providers

  1. Gratipay partners with third-party payment processors (such as Braintree)
     for payment processing. When you use these partners' services to make or
receive payments via the Service, you agree to their terms of service.

1. Nonprofits and Charities using Gratipay

  1. If your Team is associated with a nonprofit organization, soliciting
     payments on Gratipay may subject you to certain state laws regarding
charitable solicitations, including various registration, reporting, and audit
requirements. You are solely responsible for compliance with these and any
other applicable law or regulation.

  1. Gratipay makes no representation or warranty regarding the tax-exempt
     status of any Team, or the tax-deductible status of any payment made via
the Service.
